# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project explores patterns in student academic performance using exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
The goal is to understand how grades evolve over time and how effort, behavioral, and contextual factors relate to final outcomes.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Student Performance Dataset
- File used: student-mat.csv
- Records: Secondary school students (Mathematics)

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and understanding
- Feature engineering (performance trends, attendance levels)
- Grade distribution and consistency analysis
- Effort vs outcome analysis
- Internal vs final assessment reliability

## Key Focus
This project emphasizes analysis and interpretation rather than predictive modeling.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
The analysis is observational and does not establish causality.
